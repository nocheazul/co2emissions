# MATH 2315 Lab 1 - CO2 Emissions

# Description:
Lab 1 of MATH 2315 - analyzes data from Our World in Data about the world's CO2 pollution over time. Specifically, analyzing the disproportionate pollution of 2020's top 10 polluting countries.

In this analysis, I use the greenhouse gas emission data set owid-co2-data.csv from Our World in Data to describe how the emission levels of the current top 10 CO2 emitters have changed over the last 50 years (1971 - 2020). In addition, I place this information in the context of global CO2 emissions and commenting on any trends or significant observations. My analysis concludes that the today's top 10 carbon dioxide emitters have an outsized influence on global carbon dioxide emissions.

# Requirements:

Google's Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/) and the Safari web browser were used to complete this project.

# Data:

Collection of CO2 and greenhouse gas emissions data maintained by Our World In Data : https://github.com/owid/co2-data, accessed Apr. 18, 2023

# Data Processing:

Because this project is only concerned with the CO2 emissions of individual countries, the data was processed using Pandas to remove any non-country (such as regions, continents, or the world) entries in the original data frame. This process can be found in the file titled "Clean Data Frame (Only Countries)".
